                        An Implementation of the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm in the web framework Angular. Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is an algorithm that procedurally
                        generates images from predefined tiles. This project was my first entrance into frontend development with Angular. I learned about various aspects of Angular and
                        Typescript. I also started exploring CI/CD and basic DevOps using Cloudflare Pages.

                        For Pi Day 2022 (3/14/22), I created 3 different algorithms to estimate the value of Pi (~3.14159265358979323646433).

                    <ul>
                        <li>The first algorithm uses a large number of random coordinate points, and using the triangle formed by the x and y value of the point
                            to see if the point would be in the first quadrant of the circle or not. The ratio of points in the circle to the total number of points, is approximately π/4.

                        <li>
                            The second algorithm uses a principle of Calculus called a Riemann Sum (using a large number of infinitely small rectangles to find the area under a curve)
                             to aproximate the area of a semi-circle with radius 1, this finds an aproximation of π/2.

                        OpenVaxx is a desktop applet I developed to demonstrate how a COVID-19 "Vaccine Passport" could work if it were utilized state-wide or nationwide.
                         In developing this project, I learned many new skills: APP GUI programming, Computer Vision, QR Code generation and scanning, databasing, 
                         and the secure storage of information, including usernames and passwords. I submitted this for the 2021 Congressional App Challenge and Won First Place in MD District 2

                        The USB Reader plugin for hobbits is a tool for reading data from USB devices and importing the data into Hobbits, a bitwise analysis and manipulation tool. 
                        I wrote this project as a part of my internship with Software, Magic, & Rainbows in Summer 2021. Using the Libusb library for C/C++ and QT C/C++ framework,
                         I created this plugin that is currently available by default for the latest version of Hobbits for macOS and Linux.

                        I developed part of the backend, building the webserver code using the Flask framework and using web scraping and Python Data Science tools like Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, and MatPlotLib
                        to acquire and visualize COVID-19 pandemic data.

                        My Submission for the April 2021 Maryland Skills USA Computer Programming Challenge. The project is a simple app to select various pizza types,
                         sizes, and toppings and then calculate the price of the pizzas. The app won 2nd place in the Statewide Computer Programming Competition. 
                         From developing this program, I learned UI/UX programming and the WinForms API in C#.

                    <p>
                        The friendship lamp project is a project I am currently working on in my spare time, it is a lamp that lights up when the second lamp is depressed,
                         and the second lamp lights up when the first one is depressed. For this project, I am learning how to design and manufacture PCBs using KiCAD, 
                         computer networking with Raspberry Pi and Arduinos, and the process of creating firmware that is adaptive and easy to use. 
                         Above, you can see the design for the current revision of the PCB.

                    <p>
                        Above is a picture of the 3D printable lego brick I designed using specifications and technical documents I found online. 
                        My lego brick can attach to copies of itself but also official lego bricks. This project taught me how to use professional 3D Modeling Softwares, 
                        products like Fusion 360, and how to read technical documents and design products from given specifications.
